<h1>About Us</h1>
<p><img src="images/4 girls red volleyOC shirts - Copy.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt=""/></p>
<p>We are a small local company, hoping to impove our business by getting on the net. We get about 100 people playeing at Slammers each week.</p>

<p>Volleyball is a great family sport, so we think more young families would enjoy being part of what we offer – volleyball (including professional competitions sometimes), socialising, licensed bar (happy hour every day from 6-7pm), available to hire for functions – fun and fitness.</p> 

<p>We get players of all ages, but mostly they are 35 – 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience, getting kids playing while they’re in high school (15 – 30). We think more people would play and come and watch competitions if they knew about us more
